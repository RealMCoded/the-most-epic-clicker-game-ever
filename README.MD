This is a game i made in school during breaks to improve my js skills.

This is 100% raw js. no libraries, nothing else but pure js 
\*sniff* *mmmm* the fresh smell of raw javascript...

## Requirements

There aren't really any requirements since this *is* as web app. However, if you do want to play offline (for some reason), you can check out the [Offline Play](#offline-play) section for more info.

## Offline Play

The easiest way to play offline is to run `npx serve` (same command that is in `start_local.bat`) or any other localhost server (python3, for example: `python -m http.server`).
