This is a game i made in school during breaks to improve my js skills.

This is 100% raw js. no libraries, nothing else but pure js 
\*sniff* *mmmm* the fresh smell of raw javascript...

## Requirements

There aren't really any requirements since this *is* as web app. However, if you do want to play offline (for some reason), you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to start a local server (http.server).

## Offline Play
Speaking of playing offline, Double check that you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and run `start_local.bat` (quickest way) or `host-test-server.bat` (easier to set a custom IP and Port) to start a localhost server.
